Yes something around the world is spreading quickly to take off us from mother earth. But human’s bondage with this Mother Earth is too strong, until we are humans. Time will come and go; anyhow the same time will heal the problems as they arrived. My sincere request and advice to all of you is, be strong and improve immunity to fight against the spreading virus. At the same time this is the good opportunity that every one of us has to utilise it, to build bondage in families or to strengthen it, try to understand the pain of parents to save us from the outbreak. Further this time can be utilised to strengthen the areas in education where we were weak. Hope all is well. Be responsible and be safe. Take care, God Bless You.\n\n \n\nEver Yours\n\nSridhar..\n\n \n\n "
